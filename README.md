# pokeCLI
The CLI tool for interacting with the Pokemon API

## Motivation
I've been working a lot lately with various CLI tools that are using Golang under the hood and figured it be good practice to try and develop one of my own using
Cobra.

This CLI tool is allowing me to learn more about interacting with APIs using go, marshaling and unmarshaling JSON in go, and the various modules written to help create your own CLI tool.

## Usage
Right now the barebones usage is running the `pokeCLI` command to get a list of all 905 different Pokemon species.

## Roadmap
* Search for Pokemon details by name
* Search for Pokemon details by Pokedex Entry number
* List all Pokemon by Region
* List all Pokemon by Type
* List all Legendary Pokemon
* List all Starter Pokemon
